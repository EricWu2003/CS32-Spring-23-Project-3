<strong>How can I limit <code>SmartPlayer::chooseMove</code> to 5
seconds?</strong>
</p><p>
Here is an example of a Timer class you can use.
</p><p>
Suppose we're doing some recursive computation.  Let's say each non-base case
needs to solve 10 subproblems, and let's say our tree of recursive calls is
10 levels deep.  For this example, what we want to compute is simple:  Count
how many function calls in total we make.  We'll also see how long that takes.
The function is named f and takes one integer argument, which will be reduced
by 1 each level down the recursive call tree, with the argument 0 being the
base case.  In preparation for enhancements we'll get to later, f calls a
recursive function f_helper to do the real work.
</p>
<pre>//========================================================================
// Timer t;                 // create and start a timer
// t.start();               // restart the timer
// double d = t.elapsed();  // milliseconds since timer was last started
//========================================================================

#include &lt;chrono&gt;

class Timer
{
  public:
    Timer()
    {
        start();
    }
    void start()
    {
        m_time = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    }
    double elapsed() const
    {   
        std::chrono::duration&lt;double, std::milli&gt; diff =
                          std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now() - m_time;
        return diff.count();
    }
  private:
    std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::time_point m_time;
};

//========================================================================

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

unsigned long f_helper(int n);
unsigned long f(int n);

int main()
{
	unsigned long result = f(10);
	cout &lt;&lt; result / 1000000.0  &lt;&lt; " million calls" &lt;&lt; endl;
}

unsigned long f(int n)
{
	Timer timer;
	unsigned long result = f_helper(n);
	cout &lt;&lt; timer.elapsed() &lt;&lt; " ms" &lt;&lt; endl;
	return result;
}

unsigned long f_helper(int n)
{
	unsigned long callCount = 1;
	if (n == 0)
		callCount += 0;  /// do a base case computation
	else
	{
		for (int branchesLeftToExplore = 10; branchesLeftToExplore &gt; 0; branchesLeftToExplore--)
		{
			  // Explore this branch
			callCount += f_helper(n-1);
		}
	}
	return callCount;
}
</pre>
<p>
If we build this using g32fast on the SEASEnet Linux server and run it, we
get this output (although the time may be a little different between one run
and another):
</p>
<pre>21871.5 ms
11111.1 million calls
</pre>
<p>
If we want to limit execution to as much as we can get done in 5 seconds,
we can give the recursive function a time limit that it can check against.
If it sees that it's about to run out of time, then instead of doing
more recursive calls, it can use some quick non-recursive way of coming
up with an answer to return.  For a game, it might be an evaluation of the
current board state (without any further recursive lookahead).  For our
example, we'll just add 0 to the callCount.  The functions f and f_helper
now look like this:
</p>
<pre>unsigned long f(int n)
{
    double timeLimit = 4990;  // 4.99 seconds; allow 10 ms for wrapping up
    Timer timer;
    unsigned long result = f_helper(n, timeLimit, timer);
    cout &lt;&lt; timer.elapsed() &lt;&lt; " ms" &lt;&lt; endl;
    return result;
}

unsigned long f_helper(int n, double timeLimit, Timer&amp; timer)
{
    unsigned long callCount = 1;
    if (n == 0)
        callCount += 0;  /// do a base case computation
    else if (timeLimit &lt;= 0)
        callCount += 0;  //  do non-recursive heuristic computation
    else
    {
        for (int branchesLeftToExplore = 10; branchesLeftToExplore &gt; 0; branchesLeftToExplore--)
        {
              // Save start time so can compute time this branch takes
            double startTime = timer.elapsed();
              // Explore this branch
            callCount += f_helper(n-1, timeLimit, timer);
              // Adjust remaining time
            timeLimit -= (timer.elapsed() - startTime);
            if (timeLimit &lt;= 0)
                timeLimit = 0;
        }
    }
    return callCount;
}
</pre>
<p>
Now the output is this:
</p>
<pre>4990.01 ms
60.7923 million calls
</pre>
<p>
Even though the program ran in a litle less than a quarter of the time of
the original program, it didn't make anywhere near a quarter of the
recursive calls.  That's because the calls to the <code>Timer::elapsed</code>
function itself can about 50 to 600 nanoseconds, depending on your computer.
If there are many calls to that function, you may not want to call it so
often.  Here's one way:  To call <code>Timer::elapsed</code> one-thousandth
as frequently, we introduce a JumpyTimer, which calls
<code>Timer::elapsed</code> only one out of every 1000 times we call
<code>JumpyTimer::elapsed</code>; the other 999 times, it simply returns the
same value it returned before, a quick operation.  We add this JumpyTimer
class after the Timer class definition:
</p>
<pre>  // Advance jumpy timer only after jumpInterval calls to elapsed
class JumpyTimer
{
  public:
	JumpyTimer(int jumpInterval)
	 : m_jumpInterval(jumpInterval), m_callsMade(0)
	{
		actualElapsed();
	}
	double elapsed()
	{
		m_callsMade++;
		if (m_callsMade == m_jumpInterval)
		{
			m_lastElapsed = m_timer.elapsed();
			m_callsMade = 0;
		}
		return m_lastElapsed;
	}
	double actualElapsed()
	{
		m_lastElapsed = m_timer.elapsed();
		return m_lastElapsed;
	}
  private:
	Timer m_timer;
	int m_jumpInterval;
	int m_callsMade;
	int m_lastElapsed;
};
</pre>
<p>
and we chaage f and f_helper to use a jumpy timer:
</p>
<pre>unsigned long f(int n)
{
	double timeLimit = 4990;  // 4.99 seconds; allow 10 ms for wrapping up
	JumpyTimer timer(1000);
	unsigned long result = f_helper(n, timeLimit, timer);
	cout &lt;&lt; timer.actualElapsed() &lt;&lt; " ms" &lt;&lt; endl;
	return result;
}

unsigned long f_helper(int n, double timeLimit, JumpyTimer&amp; timer)
{
	...
}
</pre>
<p>
Now the output is this:
</p>
<pre>4990 ms
923.073 million calls
</pre>
<p>
That's quite a bit better, but both versions have the characteristic that
they are depth-first searches:  For the ten branches looped over in the top
level call to f_helper, the first branch is completely explored before the
second branch, etc., so if time runs out while exploring the first branch,
the other nine branches are skipped over quickly.  This is terrible for a
game tree, since if there's a win possible in, say, three moves down one of
the later top-level branches, it would not be found.
</p><p>
One way to ameliorate this is to split the time limit among the branches so
that exploring the first branch is limited to one-tenth of the time limit.
If it runs out of time, there's still time for the other branches.  Also,
if the first branch exploration finished with time left to spare, its unused
time can be allotted as additional time for the other branches.  This can be
done with a small change to the for loop in f_helper:
</p>
<pre>        for (int branchesLeftToExplore = 10; branchesLeftToExplore &gt; 0; branchesLeftToExplore--)
        {
              // Allocate remaining time limit equally among remaining braches to explore
            double thisBranchTimeLimit = timeLimit / branchesLeftToExplore;

              // Save branch start time so can compute the time the branch took
            double startTime = timer.elapsed();
              // Explore this branch
            callCount += f_helper(n-1, thisBranchTimeLimit, timer);
              // Adjust remaining time
            timeLimit -= (timer.elapsed() - startTime);
            if (timeLimit &lt;= 0)
                timeLimit = 0;
        }
</pre>
<p>
with output
</p>
<pre>4990 ms
920.853 million calls
</pre>
<p>
Not surprisingly, a similar number of function calls were made in the 5
seconds explored, but if we were to examine the pattern of how they were
called, we'd see a more even distribution of time spent in each branch.
